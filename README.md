# Reasume Parser - A ML model to validate your resumes

The Resume Parser and Skills Matcher is a Python-based web application designed to extract and analyze information from resumes (in PDF format) and match skills against predefined lists. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text extraction, named entity recognition (NER), and fuzzy string matching to identify and categorize key sections such as education, skills, and work experience from uploaded resumes.
